# Mac Keyboard Shortcuts

There's unfortunately no good way to import/export Mac keyboard shortcuts, so for now I've recorded my custom ones here.

## Mission Control

Note: in Logitech Options, need to remap the mouse side buttons to the keystroke assignments for "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" below.

| Name                            | Shortcut     | Note                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Move left a space               | `Ctrl [`     | Formerly `Ctrl LeftArrow` |
| Move right a space              | `Ctrl ]`     | Formerly `Ctrl RightArrow`|
| Mission Control                 | `Ctrl -`     | Formerly `Ctrl UpArrow`   |
| Application windows             | `Ctrl =`     | Formerly `Ctrl DownArrow` |
